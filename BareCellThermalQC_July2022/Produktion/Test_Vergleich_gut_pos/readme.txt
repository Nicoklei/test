Investigation of the effects of the positioning of the upper PGS.

The TMF_test_21 value was measured at a pressure of about 2200 kPa pre cooling and the upper PGS was ofset by about 2 mm.
This measurement was repeated at a pressure of about 2000 kPa pre cooling and the upper PGS was aligned correctly up to 1 mm.

It can be seen, that the mispositioning of the upper PGS can increases the TMF by about 0.3 cm^2k/W per mm.
